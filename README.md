**Modular JavaScript 2D engine for building and visualizing interactive simulations, UI systems, and physics worlds.**  
Built entirely on **HTML5 Canvas** and **modern ES6 modules**, DSRT provides a lightweight, high-performance framework for visual computation and creative coding.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 **Modular architecture** — organized into `core`, `ui`, `graphics`, `physics`, and `lab`
- 🔹 **Flow** and **Boolean** systems for runtime logic
- 🔹 **Canvas-based UI elements**: buttons, sliders, inputs, drag zones
- 🔹 **Particle simulation**: fire, smoke, bubbles
- 🔹 **Mechanical systems**: gear, spring, rod
- 🔹 **Laboratory visuals**: beaker, thermometer, burner
- 🔹 **Pure ES6 modules** — no external dependencies
- 🔹 Works instantly in any modern browser

### 🧠 Why this version hits harder
- Looks consistent with professional JS frameworks (Pixi.js, Three.js, p5.js).  
- Clean code fences make the tree readable.  
- The intro line under the badges gives your project immediate identity.  
- Demos and links make it feel “alive” — not a static repo.

Would you like me to write a **short landing blurb (2–3 sentences)** for the *top of your GitHub Pages homepage*, matching this README tone? It would go under the `<h1>` on your website before the canvas — the “welcome” text visitors see first.
